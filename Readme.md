# Water use efficiency (WUE) 

also known as Crop Water Productivity (CWP)

Exercises for the European Space Agency (ESA) Advanced Training Course on Land Remote Sensing with the focus on Agriculture and Water Data https://landtraining2022.esa.int/

Data for the exercises are from:
1. Google Earth Engine: 
	- Landsat
	- ERA5 reanalysis
	- Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model simulations [geeet](https://github.com/kaust-halo/geeet)
2. Copernicus high-resolution vegetation phenology and productivity product [HR-VPP](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-vegetation-phenology-and-productivity)
3. ICOS [Warm Winter 2020](https://doi.org/10.18160/2G60-ZHAK) eddy covariance flux product, FR-Lam site
